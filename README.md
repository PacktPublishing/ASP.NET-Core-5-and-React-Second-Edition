This is the code repository for [ASP.NET Core 5 and React - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/in/web-development/asp-net-core-5-and-react-second-edition), published by Packt.

**Full-stack web development using .NET 5, React 17, and TypeScript 4**

## What is this book about?
The book starts by taking you through React and TypeScript components for building an intuitive single-page application and then shows you how to design scalable REST APIs that can integrate with a React-based frontend. Next, you’ll get to grips with the latest features, popular patterns, and tools available in the React ecosystem, including function-based components, React Router, and Redux. As you progress through the chapters, you'll learn how to use React with TypeScript to make the frontend robust and maintainable and cover key ASP.NET 5 features such as API controllers, attribute routing, and model binding to build a sturdy backend. In addition to this, you’ll explore API security with ASP.NET 5 identity and authorization policies and write reliable unit tests using both .NET and React, before deploying your app on Azure.
By the end of this book, you’ll have gained the knowledge you need to enhance your C# and JavaScript skills and build full-stack, production-ready applications with ASP.NET 5 and React.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Build RESTful APIs with .NET 5 using API controllers
* Secure REST APIs with identity and authorization policies
* Create strongly typed, interactive, and function-based React components using Hooks
* Understand how to style React components using Emotion.js
* Perform client-side state management with Redux
* Run a range of automated tests on the frontend and backend
* Implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes in Azure using Azure DevOps

### Errata
* **Page 67**: Please ignore/remove points 7 & 8. As these steps are replicated from steps 2 and 3. At this point they have been completed already.
* **Page 70**: When creating the .prettierrc file in step 4, there is a missing comma at the end of the line that reads, ```"trailingComma": "all"**```. So, this line should be replaced with  ```"trailingComma": "all",```
*  **Page 114**: If using React 17+, it may appear that a “double render” doesn’t occur because “rendered” is output to the console once. A “double render” does occur but React suppresses `console.log` statements in the second render. See the note at the bottom of this React doc for more information: https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html
